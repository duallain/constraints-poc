# constraints-poc

Goal is to make a little poc for myself to learn how to do constraint programming in python.

Primary interest is understanding how to optimize things like purchasing in idle games.
But I have almost zero experience with the underlying math and with the tools available, so this poc is just to get a handle on both.


# todos

- [ ] follow some examples from the book "Practical Python AI Projects: Mathematical Models of Optimization Problems with Google OR-Tools"
- [ ] play with some type hinting in python
- [ ] generate docs with inline test-cases?
- [ ] github action to generate/publish those docs
- [ ] run tests cases for each pr
- [ ] play around with some performance measurements. Given some test inputs, which algo is fastest for example
- [ ] generate coverage
- [ ] github action to run tests on pr
